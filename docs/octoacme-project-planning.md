# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives

- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (including all relevant roles)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Define success metrics with Data Analyst
4. UX Designer creates design specifications and user flows (if UI work is involved)
5. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
6. Define Definition of Done (DoD) with input from all roles
7. Identify dependencies and integration points (engage DevOps for infrastructure needs)
8. Create release plan and milestone map with DevOps Engineer
9. Customer Success shares customer priorities and feedback
