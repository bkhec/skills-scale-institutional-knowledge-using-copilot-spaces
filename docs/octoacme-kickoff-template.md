## Tips for Effective Kickoffs

### For Project Managers
- Keep energy high and set a collaborative tone
- Ensure everyone speaks and feels heard
- Don't let technical details dominate—save deep dives for follow-ups
- Visual aids help (diagrams, mockups, timeline graphics)
- End with clear next steps and accountability

### For All Participants
- Come prepared—read the one-pager in advance
- Ask clarifying questions
- Be honest about concerns and constraints
- Take notes on your role-specific responsibilities
- Connect with your key collaborators after the meeting

### Red Flags to Watch For
- ⚠️ Unclear success metrics or definition of done
- ⚠️ Missing key roles (UX for UI-heavy projects, DevOps for infrastructure changes)
- ⚠️ Vague timeline or "we'll figure it out later" responses
- ⚠️ No one taking ownership of identified risks
- ⚠️ Team members disengaged or confused
- ⚠️ Major disagreements on approach that aren't resolved

If you see these, schedule follow-up sessions to address them before starting execution.
